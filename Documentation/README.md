# Sheffield East

This project covers the main route between Sheffield and Worksop, and the services that run along it. Also included is the Midland Main Line, popular for many north-south freight services. The line out to Stocksbridge is also mapped, but no services run over this in the included timetable.

I hope you enjoy!

## Simulation

The timetable contains all of the passenger services between Sheffield and Worksop, as well as Nottingham services which terminate at Worksop.

A large number of freight services are included, especially on the Midland Main Line, however, freight services are not included to Tinsley, Stocksbridge and Maltby.

A few passenger services run up the Midland Main Line from Chesterfield and up via Woodhouse into Sheffield, these services are included also. Additionally, there are 5 services per day that leave Sheffield towards Woodburn Junction where they turn around to use a different plaform at Sheffield.

The included timetable has multiple start points, however for the best experience, I recommend starting from 06:00, as the morning timetable is far more varied and interesting.
